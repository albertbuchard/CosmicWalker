          <h5>Welcome ! üëã üòÑ </h5>
          We thank you for your interest in testing the cosmic walker task, brought to you by Funky Encoders LLC.
          <br><br>
          <h5>General description</h5>
          The goal of the task is to predict the direction a walker made of five points is walking towards. <br>
          Because directionality is a scarce ressource you will only have to predict left or right.<br><br>

          <h5>Observe and predict when ready</h5>
          A small square will first appear to tell you to focus your attention at the center before a trial starts.
          During this phase, a center dot will be surrounded by a full square:
          <br>
            <center><img src='./assets/sprites/cross/fullSquare.svg'></center>
          <br><br>
          There will then be a short delay period when you do not need to do anything.
          <br>
          Then points will appear on the screen and will start moving. It is your job to predict the direction of motion of the dots,
          either left or right, as fast as possible. The dots are computed from the image of a person walking left or right, but during the trial,
          this natural motion will be pertubed in various ways, making the task rather difficult, even sometimes impossible. But it is important that you
          respond even when you are not sure.<br>

          Use the left and right arrow to predict the direction the walker is going, predict as fast as possible:

          As you progress, you will see a white line growing around the trial number at the bottom of the screen.
          When the line form a full square the task will be finished:
